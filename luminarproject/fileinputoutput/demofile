The good news for cricket fans and fans of T20 franchise cricket,
in particular, is that the 13th edition of the IPL, albeit late, is being played after
 the BCCI managed to shift the whole tournament to the UAE. For the first time, only three
 venues will host as many as 60 matches.
 The evening matches will begin at 7:30 pm IST, while the afternoon matches will start at 3:30 pm
