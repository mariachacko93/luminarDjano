# data structures

# data is arranged in different manner

#
# 2 data structures:
#
# 1.linear data structure-->
# **********************************
# array={10,20,30}
# elements are stored in consecutive memory location

# array
# stack
# queue
#
# 2.non linear data structure
#*************************************
# elements are stored in consecutive memory location
# *  linked list
#      node  [data,next(address of b is stored)]---->[data,next(address of c is stored]--->[data,next]
#                     # a                                     #b                                #  c
# *  binary search tree
# tree(root,left,right)
